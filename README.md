# Distance metric learning for synthetic microbial ecology studies using flow cytometry
We consider the use of distance metric learning for analyzing single-cell information coming from flow cytometry for synthetic microbiology studies.

### Prerequisites
This has been tested using MATLAB 2010A and later on Windows and Linux (Mac should be fine).

## How to use?
```matlab
L = DMLMJ(XTr, YTr, )
```
